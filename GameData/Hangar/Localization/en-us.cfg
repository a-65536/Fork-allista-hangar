		// Agents
		#LOC_Agent = AT Industries
		#LOC_Agent_description = AT Industries is a leading company in providing shelter facilities for spacecrafts and ground vehicles on other planets. But hangars it produces are complex devices and need constant testing.

		// Parts
		#LOC_Hangar2_title = Habitable Ground Hangar
		#LOC_Hangar2_description = Ever wanted to live with your beloved cargo rover in the same building? Well, now you can!

		#LOC_BoxFairings_title = Box Fairing Hangar
		#LOC_BoxFairings_description = This fairing box uses our newest Hangar (TM) technology to provide the easiest and safest transfer of your payload to other planet or moon.  

		#LOC_FairingsOcto_title = Aerodynamic Fairing Hangar
		#LOC_FairingsOcto_description = This aerodynamic fairing uses our newest Hangar (TM) technology to provide the easiest and safest transfer of your payload to orbit.  

		#LOC_InflatableHangar1_title = Inflatable Ground Hangar
		#LOC_InflatableHangar1_description = This is a simplest ground hangar possible. Hard Li-Al alloy case with compressed air tanks and inflatable box shaped balloon. No transfer of resources. Single use only!

		#LOC_InflatableHangar2_title = Advanced Inflatable Hangar
		#LOC_InflatableHangar2_description = This inflatable hangar is equipped with its own small radioisotope thermoelectric generator and light gas compressor that allows the hangar to be reused (provided the atmosphere, of course). To compensate for the weight of this additions its hull was made from composite materials and is much lighter but, consequently, less tough.
		
		#LOC_InflatableSpaceHangar_title = Inflatable Space Hangar
		#LOC_InflatableSpaceHangar_description = This inflatable pressurizable hangar is much lighter then its counterparts which makes it ideal docking solution for a space station. However, it can only store one vessel and is very fragile.  

		#LOC_InlineHangar1_title = Inline Hangar
		#LOC_InlineHangar1_description = Originally just a trashcan from Jeb's backyard, this "Inline Hangar" is capable of storing small drones and satellites. Unlike the trashcan, though, it is equipped with a docking port and a lamp.

		#LOC_InlineHangar2_title = Habitable Inline Hangar
		#LOC_InlineHangar2_description = What if you weld a hitchhiker container on top of that hangar? - Jeb once asked an engineer. Well, that's what. This hangar can store small to medium manned ships and their crew.

		#LOC_Mk3Hangar_title = Mk3 Spaceplane Hangar
		#LOC_Mk3Hangar_description = This hangar is incredibly light for its size, has integrated battery, generator, reaction wheel and fuel tanks. It is also compatible with the Mk3 form-factor, so you can build a space... well, a spaceBUS with it! 

		#LOC_RadialHangar_title = Radial Hangar
		#LOC_RadialHangar_description = Like broad designs? Than this radial, almost sqare hangar is for you. It's also better suited for long thin rocket-like spaceships than the Inline variants. No crew trasfers, though.

		#LOC_RoverLanderHangar_title = Rover Lander
		#LOC_RoverLanderHangar_description = This hangar is smaller than it's counterparts, but it has one great advantage: it can be used as a lander. And not just any lander, as it can carry a rover on board. Or two rovers. Or three rovers...
		
		#LOC_Hangar1_title = Ground Hangar
		#LOC_Hangar1_description = Tired of rovers standing here and there in the open? Pack them all into this little shelter! Comes with an anchor, big battery and solar panels. It also has the equipment for rovers refueling and recharging.

		#LOC_SmallVTOLHangar_title = Ground VTOL Hangar
		#LOC_SmallVTOLHangar_description = Now you can land your rocket on top of this metal box and stow it inside!

		#LOC_Spaceport_title = Spaceport
		#LOC_Spaceport_description = It's a Spaceport. Seriously. Three external docking nodes (don't forget to install docking ports!), HUGE hangar, C&C with observation dome and 10 kerbal cabins... The only problem is: it's heavy. You can't launch it into orbit. And even if you could, it won't fly anywhere else with modern propulsion.
